                There are different python GUI frameworks that we can 
                use to create python GUI with. These frame works are all 
                open source or have community or developers (commercial) packages. 
                 Among these the popular ones are: PYQT5 ( www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/news),
                  Tkinter (this framework is a built in to your python install and you do not 
                  need to install it separately), Wxpython (http://wxpython.org) , Kivy 
                  (the only solution to work with python code on mobile phones, 
                  it is mostly used for creating cross-platform multi-touch mobile applications) 
                   and PyForms.
